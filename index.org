** puzzle 1 ~Python3~

#+begin_quote
The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover.

On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

For example:

1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.

Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?

** puzzle 2 ~Shell~

#+begin_quote
Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".

Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:

two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen

In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.

What is the sum of all of the calibration values?

**Note**:
Why can't we just replace =one= with ~1~?

#+begin_src shell :exports both
echo "eightwo" | sd two 2 | sd eight 8
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: eigh2

If we do so, we will have problems with words, in which the numbers are intertwined.
e.g., =eightwo=

#+begin_comment
html und & machen leider bisschen probleme ...

#+BEGIN_LATEX
\[ \overunderbraces{ &\br{2}{\texttt{eight}} }{ & \texttt{eigh} & \texttt{t} & \texttt{wo} }{ && \br{2}{\texttt{two}} } \]
#+END_LATEX
#+end_comment

\[ \overbrace{ \texttt{eight}  }^8 \texttt{wo} \]  and  \[ \texttt{eigh} \underbrace{ \texttt{two} }_2 \]


#+begin_src shell :exports both :results drawer
echo "eightwo" | sd two two2two | sd eight eight8eight | \
    python3 -c "import sys; xs: str = sys.stdin.read(); \
                print(f'{xs} -> {[x for x in xs if x.isdigit()]}')"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:results:
eight8eightwo2two
 -> ['8', '2']
:end:


If we now aply the ~day1 :: String -> Int~ function form above to the normalized / cleaned  data, we will receive
call_day1p1(data=day1p2cleanData) {{{results(=281=)}}},
as expected.


* Day 2 ~haskell~

** puzzle 1 ~haskell~

#+begin_quote
For example, the record of a few games might look like this:

- Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
- Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
- Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
- Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
- Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green

In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again).
The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes;
the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes;
the third set is only 2 green cubes.

The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?

* Day 3

** puzzle 1

#+begin_quote
The engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can add up all the part numbers in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.

The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a "part number" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (.) do not count as a symbol.)

Here is an example engine schematic:
